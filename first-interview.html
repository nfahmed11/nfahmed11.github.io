                <p>
                  I just had my very first real interview. I've been doing a few
                  interviews with recruiters where they ask me basic questions
                  about work status and work visa and background but it only
                  lasts 15 minutes. This one was a whole 30 minutes, maybe
                  longer, I wish I looked at the time. OHMYLORD. MY ARMPITS WEAR
                  SWEATING, MY BODY WAS SHAKING. I WAS SO TENSE. But it went so
                  well alhamdulilah, as well as it could have gone with my
                  experience and knowledge, i think i bombed like two questions
                  where she asked about how familiar are you with SEO and google
                  analytics, and i was like UHHHHHH. ZERO FAMILIARITY. She
                  turned away to find another interview question to which I was
                  like “BUUUTTTTT its not to say I cant learn it, if put in the
                  position, I will exhaust my resources to learn,” which i think
                  is important to say because employers want to know if you are
                  willing to put yourself out there and learn new things. Omg
                  I'm still freaking out about this interview. How did I land an
                  interview in the first place? Jeeeeeezzzz. Okay so it is a
                  small company here is the link :
                  https://www.livlenmedia.com/home#get-started They are based
                  out of midland texas and have a small team of like 10 people.
                  She was like Most live in texas but they don't have many web
                  devs who are located in texas. It would be remote work. We
                  touched on SO MANY THINGS. She asked me how familiar am i with
                  css and js on a scale of 1 to 10, and i was like “i don't want
                  to sound over confident but like a 8-9, i know there is always
                  more to learn, languages are forever changing but as of now, i
                  would say i am pretty damn near comfortable with those
                  languages.” She asked me why I chose web dev as a career, and
                  I explained to her that I am very passionate about creative,
                  aesthetically pleasing web pages and solving problems. I enjoy
                  being challenged and I felt like my careers in the past did
                  not offer that to me. It's not the end result that drives me
                  but the process of getting there and I LOVE to mesh creativity
                  and coding skills.” She also asked me about my background. I
                  told her i'm a self taught web developer , i had my word
                  document with notes open on the side lmao. I told her it
                  started off as a side hobby, then turned into a full time
                  career when i realized i was not satisfied with my previous
                  careers. I told her I graduated from uncg with a degree in
                  architecture and didnt feel like I was being challenged. I
                  expressed my need to be creative and started to look into
                  bootcamps courses , talked about juno and my side projects
                  from there. When I first started the interview, our videos
                  were both on, but she kept saying she couldn't hear me. So I
                  kept tampering with it and my sweaty pits were getting larger
                  and larger. Then finally something worked. But in the process
                  my evenly divided desktop with notes on one side and interview
                  video on the other was not laid out like I wanted. So I had to
                  talk and try to quietly reorganize my desktop page so I could
                  see both. She told me she's more inclined towards self taught
                  developers because it shows a willingness to learn new things
                  and drive whereas someone who has a background in cs where it
                  was their degree, might be stuck and not want to learn more. I
                  expressed that I am self taught in other areas and that's why
                  I was super excited about the fact that she contacted me.
                  Their company has a lot of things that interest me and I
                  noticed they were hiring for a lot of other creative fields
                  and I expressed that they have a lot to offer in terms of
                  those areas too. I was asked about what i'm looking for in
                  terms of work, i told her my focus is on the front end at the
                  moment, but i see myself becoming full stack in the near
                  future. I want a company that will help me grow and teach me
                  and in turn where i can offer my talents in all aspects, not
                  just coding. She asked about my favorite project I have worked
                  on, pulled up my resume, and opened the masala india website,
                  then she asked my the process of building a website, i told
                  her i like to make a list of what the apages will be, will it
                  be all one page or multiple subpages, then draw it out
                  according to what it should look like, color scheme, fonts,
                  then i do my coding in visual studio code and i use google
                  chrome debugger to inspect my elements and javascript and
                  twerk as i go along. She asked about my favorite coding tools.
                  I listed visual studio code as my editor, github, codepen,
                  scss, bootstrap library and a quick reason as to why. She
                  asked what does it look like for you working with a client?
                  How do you go about creating the designs? How often do you
                  communicate with clients? what websites i use to keep up with
                  new tech, what blogs i read? i told her i'm on udemy, scrimba
                  lately learning react, i told her about colt steel and i did
                  his react and bootcamp as well. She asked how I work with
                  multiple projects/ multi tasking, how do i prioritize multiple
                  projects/tasks. I told her i on a daily basis make a list of
                  things i need to accomplish and it is according to the
                  deadlines i have set, i have one for a weekly and monthly
                  basis and i am very good with juggling multiple projects SHE
                  ALSO ASKED WHAT'S THE MOST OVERLOOKED THING IN WEB PAGES, I
                  answered that the navigation and layout is very important, the
                  user experience is super important you want it to be easy on
                  the eyes, someone to come to the webpage and be able to
                  quickly achieve what they are trying to do, less is more, you
                  don't want the user to get frustrated and leave your webpage.
                  Then she asked me if i have any questions and i said id done
                  some research but if she could tell me about her company and
                  the business, she explained they have multiple business within
                  one and asked if i would be open to working with anyone, and
                  give input towards any of the others, and i was like HECK
                  YEAHHHHHH. I asked about what the work day looks like with
                  remote, she said we do hybrid with meetings in person once a
                  week buyt remote would be as long as its online on mondays 10
                  -11 She express her previous coworker went remote and was not
                  great at communication, i told her about how i'm always early
                  to everything. I was here 15 minutes before the interview even
                  started, i am very good at communicating, and am quick to
                  respond to phone calls, texts, emails. Omg i think it went
                  well, ya allah please don't let her find anyone better, i did
                  so much research on them, i stalked everyone on linkedin, they
                  have a total of 10 members. But i know their side hobbies,
                  foods, where they are from. What is wrong with me? I am going
                  to work on wordpress/squarespace and learn some more about it.
                  MY HEART IS BEATING SO FAST. OHMYALLAH. Time to go send in
                  more job applications. Can't get too comfortable yet until I
                  actually land a job. LOVE YOU ALLAH. YOU ARE SO GREAT TO ME.
                </p>
